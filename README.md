# Rationale
Sexual health is an important part of a person's wellbeing, including women of childbearing age. Sexual function decline has been plausibly linked to vaginal delivery due to the potential for mechanistic damage of the perineum and pelvic floor muscles. The literature is conflicting as to whether delivering children naturally actually results in women experiencing reduced sexual satisfaction and that delivering via caesarean section is protective of such decline. With rates of caesarean section on the rise, it is important to employ robust causal inference methods to better understand the relationship between mode of delivery and subsequent maternal sexual satisfaction and frequency, to better inform mum' and their doctors in obstetric decision making.

Current evidence has been derived using short follow-up times or cross-sectional study designs in the immediate post-partum period, limiting our ability to be able to distinguish between the transient and permanent effects of childbirth on sexual outcomes. The focus on sexual pain in the absence of other outcomes also leaves questions surrounding enjoyment of sex unanswered in the literature.

# Aims & Objectives 
This project will first aim to use longitudinal models to understand the trajectories of sexual enjoyment and frequency over time (between 33 months and 18 years). These trajectories will then be considered in the context of different delivery groups, to further understand the relationship of mode of delivery and sexual outcomes over time postpartum. Mode of delivery will be stratified by vaginal delivery and caesarean section; vaginal delivery will then be further stratified into instrumental and non-instrumental & episiotomy and tear. Caesarean section will be further stratified into emergency and elective.

Pain will explored as a secondary outcome, as well as in the context of the longitudinal models. This project will utilise ordinal logistic regression and multiple imputation to deal with missing data in this cohort.

# Methods
1. Extract & clean the questionnaire & clincal data from mum's enrolled in ALSPAC & derive variables
2. Explore types of exposure & outcome at each timepoint
3. Provide participant characteristics for covariates across timepoints in each delivery group
4. Create longitudinal models for each sexual outcome
5. Perform logistic regression to generate odds for enjoying sex in each delivery group and ordinal logistic regression for sexual frequency
6. Develop an imputation model to deal with the missing data present in the cohort
