# Rationale
Sexual health is an important part of a person's wellbeing, including women of childbearing age. Sexual function decline has been plausibly linked to vaginal delivery due to the potential for mechanistic damage of the perineum and pelvic floor muscles. The literature is conflicting as to whether delivering children naturally actually results in women experiencing reduced sexual satisfaction and that delivering via caesarean section is protective of such decline. With rates of caesarean section on the rise, it is important to employ robust causal inference methods to better understand the relationship between mode of delivery and subsequent maternal sexual satisfaction and frequency, to better inform mum' and their doctors in obstetric decision making.

Current evidence has been derived using short follow-up times or cross-sectional study designs in the immediate post-partum period, limiting our ability to be able to distinguish between the transient and permanent effects of childbirth on sexual outcomes. The focus on sexual pain in the absence of other outcomes also leaves questions surrounding enjoyment of sex unanswered in the literature.

# Aims & Objectives 
This project will first describe the participant characteristics of the women in ALSPAC with mode of delivery data at 33 months postpartum. Participant characteristics will also be described for mum's at 18 years postpartum to compare non-responders. Each outcome (sexual frequency & satisfaction) will then be described using ordinal logistic regression (crude & adjusted), for each timepoint where they are both available, in complete cases. Exposures compared: vaginal delivery vs caesarean section, instrumental delivery vs non-instrumental and elective vs emergency caesarean. Utilise methods of dealing with missing data to mitigate the bias that is created by relying on a complete case analysis. 

Explore sexual pain in the vagina during sex and elsewhere after sex (11 years postpartum) for each of these exposure comparisons. Again, utilise ordinal logistic regression to maintain the richeness of the categorical data for this outcome.

# Methods
1. Extract & clean the questionnaire & clincal data from mum's enrolled in ALSPAC & derive variables
2. Explore types of exposure & outcome at each timepoint
3. Provide participant characteristics for covariates across timepoints in each delivery group
4. Perform ordinal logistic regression to generate odds for enjoying sex and for sexual frequency in each delivery group 
5. Develop an imputation model to deal with the missing data present in the cohort
