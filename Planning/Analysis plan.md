# Analysis Plan for Mode of Delivery Study

Author: Flo Martin

Date: 11/11/2020

## Research question
Is mode of delivery associated with subsequent maternal enjoyment, frequency or pain at different time-points in the ALSPAC cohort? Is caesarean section protective of sexual function or is type of intervention more prone to sexual function decline than others?

## Overview
I am going to use the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort to investigate mode of delivery and its potential association with maternal sexual outcomes at various time-points postpartum. I will first describe the participant characteristics of the women enrolled at the earliest time-point with both sexual enjoyment and frequency (33 months postpartum) and then compare these characteristics to responders at 18 years to both questions. Aiming to include all timepoints where both outcomes are described in the context of a longitudinal model.

Having described the women in the delivery groups, I will then move onto using logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression to understand the relationship between mode of delivery and sexual enjoymnt and frequency, respectively. I will generate crude and adjusted models for maternal age, parity, maternal BMI, maternal social class, anxiety and depression. We will then develop an imputation model to deal with missing data in this dataset and perform a sensitivity analysis for women reporting 'no sex at the moment'.

### Section 1 - Preparing & cleaning the data
- [x] Check the cleaning & recoding script from Jun/Jul '20
- [x] Condense the regressions for each time-point into loops
- [x] Re-pull the dataset including variable stratifying type of caesarean section
- [ ] Define exposure groups (modes of delivery)
- [ ] Describe the cohort at each time-point for each outcome
- [ ] Develop a longitudinal model to describe each outcome
- [ ] Describe participant characteristics

### Section 2 - Analysing the data
- [ ] Run ordinal logistic regression models for crude & adjusted (for maternal age & BMI, parity, anxiety & depression) models
  - Vaginal delivery vs caesarean section for outcomes at each timepoint
  - Instrumental vs non-instrumental vaginal for outcomes at each timepoint
  - Elective vs emergency caesarean section for outcomes at each timepoint (if N high enough)
- [ ] Deal with missing data
